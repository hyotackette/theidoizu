When I tell my app to use its ability to determine the direction I'm facing, it turns to slightly east of north - I believe this is magnetic north. The problem is, when I did this, I was facing due south! Does anyone know what could be going on? Otherwise it works fine, but I have to disable the feature.

Уважаемый посетитель, Вы зашли на сайт как незарегистрированный пользователь. 15 Best Stargazing Apps for iPhones and Androids. It's like a planetarium in your pocket (sometimes for free). A few years back (around the time the Droid first came our) I had an app that would use the GPS and accelerometer on my phone to let me point to stars and would show me information about an individual star. It would show me the name, distance, date of discovery of various cosmic bodies like planets, stars, comets, etc. It would outline the constellations and I could search for a stars name and it would point towards it. I switched to iOS shortly after and remember being unable BELOFF 2019.2.1 minstall vs wpi PC / Русский ISO руторг скачать торрент бесплатно и без регистрации с открытого торрент трекера.

Hey all! I see one star today hanging out a bit away from the moon - can anyone tell me which one it is? Much thanks. I hardly ever see stars. Programs Compatible with Nex. Star, CGE, CGE Pro, CGEM and AS- GT Scopes. Following is a list of programs that claim compatibility with various models of Nex. Star. telescopes. My wife and I have a baby boy due in May and wanted an astronomy themed nursery. I'd love to have a real-time planetarium in the nursery that could be used as a night light or just to entertain us when we're up for middle of the night feedings. Does anything other than the basic light bulb with a disk with random holes in it exist. The end of Iridium flares? The first generation of Iridium satellites are being replaced with satellites of a new design which, unfortunately, are not expected to produce predictable flares. I mean, is there some free app where you input your coordinates and time and it shows you which stars and planets are visible on the sky? (it must be compatible with Android). Oppure, ed è qui che GeoGebra diventa interessante anche per gli studenti di algebra, inserendo equazioni e formule.

This page lists good quality free and open-source software that anyone can download at no cost and use or modify freely. Plenty more quality open-source software exists – this is just an introductory sample. I'm looking for something like this site: But with a nicer, cleaner interface and that allows you to change No matter the operating system, what are some great apps for me to take on my next session? It seems that there's a lot that do similar jobs but still have minute differences. Looking for a good astronomy app. point at sky and let me know what im seeing kind of thing, if it exists. Any other good science. I just looked up at the sky and noticed a star that was twinkling in a way that I'd never seen before. It's mostly blue, but seemed flicker between green and red as well. This might be an interesting phenomena, I don't think it was Sirius or Rigel, the usual suspects. Any ideas? The location: Newport Beach, CA. 1:50 AM local time (pacific standard). I'm in Bermuda for a holiday, and last night I had a crystal clear view of the Moon, Venus, and what i'm pretty sure was Jupiter (all three in a nice line to my south). Is there some website I can hit to see where stars will be on a given night and location? Like, sort of a google maps thing, but facing the other way, and customizable to a location and time? Yes, I tried googling first. Is there a program where I can type in my location and it will show me all the stars that are visible at night. 
I recently found my old telescope and now that I'm actually interested in the sky, I'm ready to get started and I want to learn about the night sky so that I know what to look for. Does anyone know of a good program that shows a map of the night sky (as in where to look), and show when planets or other events are in view? Thanks in advance. I want to explore the sky on my own. I do not have any astronomy club near by. Having to hold down a full time 6 days a week job, hence get no time to go to meetings of my astronomy club. I wanted to know if the Celestron SkyScout is now relevant when we have so many android based apps. The cost of this device is not an issue. I want something I can use to find the objects in sky reliably when I do not have any one to cross check I'm looking for an app that will take into account the time, and my location and let me know what interesting objects are up. I know these exist for iOS, but I've been struggling to find an android version. 
I'm not sure if this is something that bothers anyone else, or if anyone here is interested in helping with this project, but I'm tired of dot/hidden folders filling my home folder. I've been making a list of programs that create these folders, and I'm trying to make bug reports / feature requests to the projects. If anyone here is interested, maybe we could work together and make this list bigger, and a few of us can create the reports. I've found that the developers of these projects I'm thinking of building a web service capable of generating printable, time-and-location-accurate star charts. Charts in sky atlases represent the sky configuration only for average latitudes. Similar online services publish maps that are accurate only during the early hours of the evening. So they kind of defy the purpose of a map; each for its reason. I've tried them, and either because of the difficulty of handling a book while pointing the telescope, or because of a section For those interested, I just released a completely free (including ad-free) astronomy app that’s designed to help you know what planets, Messier and Caldwell objects are in the sky and their current altitude/azimuth and rise/set times. It’s really geared towards those of us who like to pull out our star atlases and star hop our way though the night sky. There are constellation charts included as well. I tried to make it especially useful for Messier Marathons as well as completing the Astron. I inherited an old (cheap?) telescope from my Uncle.

I'll be going up to where there's little to no light pollution tomorrow night for a camp-out wedding and am going to dry-run set it up tonight and hopefully figure out how to use it well enough to get some views of saturn/jupiter and any cool nebul. Looking for an Android app that will tell me where and when I can see the milky way. I've read about stellarium and I think it can do this? It also seems quite complex. I'm just starting out so all I really need is to know if I'm in a certain location, where galaxies will be visible and in what direction. I've heard that there are some good photography specific apps that help with this as well as other features. hello /r/telescope i have a hiking trip later in the 21 april and the site is quite dark (dark green area from darkskyfinder, location: -7.1971633 109.9321795) and i want to bring my 10x50 bins for observing. the problem is i'm still new to this astronomy thing and still hard for me to navigate the sky, some messier and constellation that i can identify quickly is orion with orion nebul and taurus with pleiades. my question is how to plan my observing night so i can find as many interesting. Hello all! I've bought a new cellphone for my canadian tour this summer (Vancouver to St-John's) and was looking for a map app. I found OruxMaps (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orux.oruxmapsampfeature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5vcnV4Lm9ydXhtYXBzIl0), which seems to be really good! The thought then came to me : What would be the apps that I wouldn't think of that could really change my tour? Anything really, from essentials to "just for fun" apps!. Here's a list of 5 planetarium software for Windows 10 which you can use to explore the nigh sky and learn about the stars around.
