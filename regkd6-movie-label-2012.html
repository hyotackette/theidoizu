Explanation of the multiverse theory and its implications: The functional quantum theory of Endgame is the many worlds theory , or the Multiverse. This is a fairly old theory, and you can read up on it below. Also cf. comic books. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation With this theory we can establish: 1. The main Universe as α-MCU. 2. From our vantage, and the α-characters, this is the trunk of the tree. Every other "multiverse" splits off sometime in the "past".

At least that's might be the mentality of those who, like me, started using it as soon as social networks started to catch up around 2005 (I’m showing my age, I know). sure, that mentality might seem a little bit too ''old man yell at clouds'' for most (mostly younger) people, and I agree with that sentiment to some extent, but even the most fervent defenders would agree that the current climate has helped rise a society based.

It’s been a few days since the conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Infinity Saga has been released and the most hardcore fans and casual moviegoers alike were treated to one of the most incredibly satisfying spectacles ever to grace the big screen. And while many loose ends were tied, inevitably, many questions still remain. the biggest, arguably, revolving around time travel, alternate timelines, paradoxes and the like.

Final Fantasy Versus XIII was named specifically as one of the Fabula Nova Crystallis collective titles, there were other games that never made it, including one that was only trademarked and never otherwise announced (see: FINAL FANTASY HAERESIS XIII, which was trademarked internationally and then abandoned by Square-Enix ( There's been quite a lot of misinformation regarding Versus This is not how I prefer to spend my Sunday afternoons, but after seeing the “argument” by /u/Se-lena, I felt compelled to respond. TL;DR : /u/Se-lena’s post is a weak argument, and relies on readers to take the post at face value, uses only a single bias source as reference, and relies on salacious rumour and lurid innuendo to make the “ appeal to emotion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion)” logical fallacy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) in order to convince readers.
